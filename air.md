There are many scenarios where capture clerks manually 
capture key fields from documents on a regular basis.


* What if every time the capture clerk captures a 
document the system remembers the document layout.
* What if the system can learn to automatically 
predict what fields to capture for future documents.


This is what the AIR platform does to streamline the
manual capture process.

Using a grid of features like text mask, position 
and nearby words.

AIR uses machine learning to extract keywords from documents
using previous company documents as training.


This is useful in streamlining many [business processes](solutions.html).
