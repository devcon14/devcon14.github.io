# The cost of invoice processing


The difficulty with invoice processing is that even in todays electronic age
it still usually a manual process.

* A PDF invoice is generated from the supplier accounting system.
* The PDF is printed out and posted to client.
* Invoices are scanned as images and run through OCR.
* Data capture staff capture the key fields.

This process is unnecessarily costly and time consuming.
One would assume that EDI would be the solution.

But EDI systems are usually expensive and complicated to install, so they are only configured for
large suppliers.


What if the PDF was emailed directly to the supplier.

Could software be used to accurately read the electronic information from the PDF?

## This is what Airvoice does.

Using machine learning technology to remember different invoice layouts 
it reads the invoice details from electronic PDF.

It is a system that is easy for suppliers to adopt and streamlines costly 
invoice processing systems.
